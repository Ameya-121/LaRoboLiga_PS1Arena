<h1 align="center">~ PS1 ARENA ~</h1>
</p>

### La Robo Liga is a Robot-Control and Image-Processing based Robotics Competition being organized by the Robotics Club, IIT (BHU), Varanasi so that we can learn about image processing, simulating robots and can also control them with help of algorithms and come out of pandemic blues. 
### This repo holds the first problem statement of event and its arena. The Arena is in the form of an OpenAI gym and runs on python libraries like `Pybullet` and `OpenCV`.
### You can learn its installation from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrbAudk7ipE">here</a>.
